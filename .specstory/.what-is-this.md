# 📁 .specstory/ – Seraphine Design System Metadata

**Welcome to the neural core of Seraphine Hybrid V1.**  
This hidden folder serves as the design system capsule – a place where Seraphine’s structure, style, and system logic are silently documented and remembered.

---

## 🌟 What Is This?

This folder was generated as part of the design-to-code workflow using:

- 🧠 **Figma Design System**

- 🛠️ **Builder.io Smart Export**

- 🪄 **AI-powered layout mapping**

- 🧩 **Seraphine’s modular design philosophy**

It contains internal references, export history, metadata, or mapping logs that were auto-generated during the transformation from **visual prototype (Figma)** to **live components (React/TypeScript/Vite)**.

You may see system files such as:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `.what-is-this.md` | This documentation (you're reading it now 💙) |
| `history/` | Logs and data from export, changes, or source tracking |
| `*.json` | Metadata used to preserve layout grid, AI tokens, or element mappings |

---

## 🧠 Should You Keep This Folder?

Yes — if you:

- Use Builder.io, Figma AI plugin, or plan to re-export with mapping.
- Want to maintain design traceability and history.
- Share this project with a team, investor, or developer.
- Plan to auto-sync design updates in the future.

You can **safely ignore it** for production builds or deployment.  
But it’s **recommended to keep this folder inside your Git repository** as part of Seraphine’s internal brain.
